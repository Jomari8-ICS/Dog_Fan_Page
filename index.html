  <h2>Chihuahua History:</h2>
    <div>
    <p>Chihuahuas, our small beloved fiends friends originated from the country of Mexico! 
    Predicted to be descendants of the Techichi, a small dog breed domesticated by pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations. 
    They have existed long ago with Toltecs and Aztecs as companion dogs.</p>
    <div>
    <p>Chihuahuas now and from those before still have their existing characteristics! Small, snappy, and full of explosive energy.
    These dogs are easy to take around! 
    Due to their relatively small size and lightweight, they are one of the best dogs if you are currently living in tight-fitted areas!
